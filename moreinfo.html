<p>For totally new kayakers, we offer beginners courses which run for 6 weeks between April and September. Sessions are usually run on Wednesday Evenings at 6pm, finishing around 8:30pm, but keep an eye on our Facebook Page for the most up to date information. These are run from our base in the Bianconi Car Park, Killorglin, on the River Laune. This is a great location where we can learn the basics, go on short journeys, and practice skills. The cost of the course is â‚¬100, this includes all training and equipment, the Level 2 assessment, and membership to both the club and Canoeing Ireland for the calendar year.</p>

<p>Here you can see the Canoeing Ireland skills award syllabus for <a href="https://canoe.ie/skills-awards/level-1-kayak-skills-award/" target="_blank">Level 1</a> and <a href="https://canoe.ie/skills-awards/level-2-kayak-skills-award/" target="_blank">Level 2</a>.</p>
