<p class="h2">Paddling</p>
<p>During the winter, we run mainly whitewater trips, every other weekend. This is based on water levels and the skills of the people attending. A decision on location is usually made on the day. If there is a lot of rain during the summer, we may run trips as well, but these will be on an ad-hoc basis.</p>
<p>During the summer, our members can be found hanging out at the regular Wednesday evening sessions. </p>

<p class="h2">Social</p>
<p>At Kerry Canoe Club, we're a social bunch! We have two annual get-togethers, a summer BBQ and a christmas picnic. Both are usually preceded by a paddle on the River Laune. Members put in a great deal of time and effort to make these events a success, often out of their own pocket!</p>
<p>As well as the annual events, members can often be found in one of Killorglin's drinking establishment for chats and a bite to eat after summer evening beginners sessions on the River Laune.</p>
