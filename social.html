<p>At Kerry Canoe Club, we're a social bunch! We have two annual get-togethers, a summer BBQ and a christmas picnic. Both are usually preceded by a paddle on the River Laune. Members put in a great deal of time and effort to make these events a success, often out of their own pocket!</p>
<p>As well as the annual events, members can often be found in one of Killorglin's drinking establishment for chats and a bite to eat after summer evening beginners sessions on the River Laune.</p>
