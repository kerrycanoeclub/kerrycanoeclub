<p class="h2">Online Payment</p>

<p>For 2021, Kerry Canoe Club have introduced paperless (and cashless) membership. The membership form is all online, and the member data stored 
  electronically adhering to GDPR guidlines. Payments going forwards will all be taken online using Stripe for members who are only paying KCC membership.
</p>
<p>
  However, for 2022, members paying for full KCC membership including Canoing Ireland membership will be processed on the Canoeing Ireland portal. 
  You will need to log in to <a href="https://membership.canoe.ie/" class="link_button" target="_blank">Canoeing Ireland</a> to pay for your membership.
</p>

<p class="h2">KCC Membership (without Canoeing Ireland) (€35)</p>
 
<p>Only select payment via this option if you already have Canoeing Ireland membership through other means.
  E.g. through work or membership with another kayaking club. For 2021, the KCC membership fee is €35</p>

<p><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/5kAcOz9fL0KF000fZ0" class="link_button" target="_blank">Pay Partial KCC Membership (€35)</a></p>

<p>When selecting the payment link above, you will be redirected away from the KCC website to a secure payment page, hosted by Stripe, 
  where you can make card payments for the selected membership option.</p>
