<p class="h2">What should I bring to my first session?</p>
<p>We provide the kayaks and all the kayaking gear. However you will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Footwear that can get wet and won't fall off if you are swimming - old runners are perfect</li>
    <li>Shorts</li>
    <li>A lightweight top - not cotton, sorts tops such as running tops, jerseys etc are good</li>
    <li>If the weather is cold or windy an old waterproof jacket and old water proof trousers can be good also</li>
    <li>A <strong>Full</strong> change of clothes</li>
    <li>A completed membership form. Download from <a href="/membership_form.pdf">here</a>.</li>
    <li>The membership fee</li>
</ul>
<p class="h2">Can my son/daughter join?</p>
<p>Unfortunately at the moment we are an over 18s club only.</p>
<p class="h2">Do I need my own kayak?</p>
<p>No. We can provide you with a kayak from our fleet.</p>
<p class="h2">It's getting cold - what clothing should I buy?</p>
<p>This is a hard question - it depends on how much you want to spend and how cold is the weather you want to paddle in.
    There is a list below of items you might want to get. Start at the top and work your way down.
    Definitely do <strong>not</strong> purchase anything before coming to a few sessions first and talking to other members.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Thermal tops and bottoms.</strong> These can be <a href="https://www.greatoutdoors.ie/shop/clothing/kayak-canoe-clothing/thermals">fancy</a> or <a href="https://ie.sportsdirect.com/skiing/mens-ski-wear/mens-ski-thermals">cheap</a> but are a great first purchase. They are also useful for hiking and other sports.
    They need to be tight fitting and warm when wet - so no cotton. Surf Rash vests, Merino, Fleeces and even Pennys Thermal vests can all be good.</li>
    <li><strong>A Cag.</strong> This is a waterproof top for kayaking. The best ones will keep you quite dry even when swimming.
        It is worth spending a little money on one of these as a good cag will increase your comfort levels dramatically.
        Some examples from: <a href="https://www.greatoutdoors.ie/shop/clothing/kayak-canoe-clothing/top">Great Outdoors</a>,
        <a href="https://www.bantry-bay-canoes.com/clothing/cags/">Bantry Bay Canoes</a>
        and <a href="https://www.lomo.co.uk/acatalog/dry-tops-cags-spray.html">Lomo</a> </li>
    <li><strong>A Wetsuit.</strong> Some paddlers swear by a wetsuit and some detest them. If you have good thermals and a good cag you might not need one.
        That said, for beginners wetsuits do have a lot of advantages.
        They keep you warm while swimming and they also protect you a little from scrapes and bruises when you are swimming.
    There is a huge range of wetsuits from the suppliers mentioned above.
        The key thing for kayaking is that the suit is flexible enough for you to paddle without chafing or discomfort.</li>
    <li><strong>Footwear.</strong> An old pair of runners with some woolly socks will get you a long way. Talk to some members if you want to upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with most sports, you can spend a lot of money on extra kit, but the above will get you started. Members often have second hand gear for sale so ask about this too.</p>
