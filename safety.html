        <p>At Kerry Canoe Club we put on regular trasining sessions for our members on the RSR 1 and RSR 2 courses. Checkout the Canoeing Ireland syllabus for each of the levels - <a href="https://canoe.ie/river-safety-and-rescue-training/"

        </p>
        <p>Being competent in RSR gives our members the skills they need to keep themselves and each other safe.</p>
